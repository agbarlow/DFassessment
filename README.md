Final Project for Bootcamp

The National Dragon Fruit Assessment Reporting Site

Purpose:  Create a reporting website to streamline process for the farmers to easily and efficiently submit their monthly shipping weights to the National Dragon Fruit Association.  In addition, this site will create an immediate invoice to allow the farmers to send payment immediately.

Time Savings to the Farmers: Current Process approximately 30 mins / month.  New System: 5 minutes / month.

Time Savings to NDA Assessment Clerk: 40 hours / month to 15 hours / month.


Design & Layout:

This site will be created using PHP language and the Laravel Platform.  All data will be in SQL via MYSQL.  Also will be used elements of Java for dropdown functionality.

The initial log-in will direct the user/farmer to the log page.  He will also have a page that shows a register of recent submissions, copies of invoices and notes of when payment was received.

The admins – after log in – will have access to see who has recently submitted additional information, the option to mark invoices paid based on receipt of payment and a report screen to alert of any farmer going 90 days based due date.

USDA will also be giving a log-on screen however those pages are still being discussed based on their needs.
